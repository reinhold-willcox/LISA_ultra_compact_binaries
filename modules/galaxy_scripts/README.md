Output description:
- Each line may be seen a DWD representative of many actual present-day DWDs; the code keeps track of the total number of the actual systems

Columns:
- Bin: Galactic bin as defined in the Besancon model
- Age: The age of the DWD in Myr
- FeH: Progenitor metallicity (the binary evolution assumed solar metallicity and this is just a tag showing the actual metallicity the system should have had)
- Xkpc, Ykpc, Zkpc: absolute Cartesian Galactic position of the binary (Galactic center is at the origin)
- Rkpc, Th: polar coordinates that can be used instead of Xkpc, Ykpc
- XRelkpc, YRelkpc, ZRelkpc, RRelkpc: same as above, but relative to the Sun
- Galb, Gall: Galactictocentric angles
- ID: the ID of the binary simulation
- UID: the UID (unique ID acress runs) of the binary simulation
- time: time in Myr or the DWD binary formation (check)
- event: event type (binCodex classification) preceding the DWD binary formation
- semiMajor, eccentricity: semimajor axis (in RSun) and eccentricity at the moment of DWD formation
- type1, mass1, radius1, Teff1, massHeCore1: WD type that came from the former primary, its mass (in MSun), radius (in RSun), effective temperature at formation (in K), He core mass (in MSun)
- type2, mass2, radius2, Teff2, massHeCore2: same, for the WD that came from the former secondary
- RDonorRSun: the radius of the WD (in RSun) that will eventually become the donor after the GW inspiral
- qSet: mDonor/mAccretor once mass transfer starts
- aRLORSun: Orbital separation (in RSun) for Roche lobe overflow to start
- PSetDWDFormHours: Orbital period (in hours) at the moment of DWD binary formation
- PSetRLOHours: Orbital period (in hours) at the moment of Roche lobe overflow
- TGWMyrSetTot: Total time (in Myr) it would take for two point masses to spiral in starting from the DWD binary orbit
- aLISABandRSun: The orbital separation of the binary (in RSun) once it enters the LISA band
- TGWMyrToLISABandSet: The time it takes for the binary to enter the LISA band (in Myr), set to 0 if it is already in the LISA band
- TGWMyrLISABandToRLOSet: The time it takes for the binary between entering the LISA band (or, if inside, from its current time) till Roche lobe overflow (in Myr)
- AbsTimeToLISAMyr: Absolute time when the binary enters the LISA band, starting from ZAMS (in Myr, check)
- AbsTimeToLISAEndMyr: Absolute time when the binary starts the RLO, relative to ZAMS (in Myr)
- SubBinAbsID: Galactic bins (column 1) are split into sub-bins with a smaller timestep - this is the absolute ID of such sub-bin
- SubBinLocalID: The number of sub-bin within the current bin
- BinID: Again the Galactic bin, counting from 0
- SubBinMidAge: the median age (in Myr) of the current Galactic sub-bin
- SubBinDeltaT: the time interval of the current sub-bin
- SubBinNDWDsCode: how many unique simulated representative DWDs are there in the current sub-bin
- SubBinNDWDsReal: how many real DWD binaries have been produced by the current sub-bin
- ATodayRSun: present-day orbital separation (in RSun) of the DWD binary
- PSetTodayHours: present-day orbital period (in hourse) of the DWD binary
